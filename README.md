# mixtape-poc

Type a music prompt → Claude curates an 8-track mixtape with liner notes →
tracks are resolved against Spotify → a record-sleeve card renders → save it
to your Spotify account.

## Setup

1. Fill in credentials:

   ```sh
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   # edit server/.env — SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

   The Spotify app's redirect URI must be exactly `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`.

2. Install:

   ```sh
   (cd server && npm install)
   (cd client && npm install)
   ```

## Run

In two terminals:

```sh
cd server && npm run dev   # Express on http://127.0.0.1:8888
cd client && npm run dev   # Vite — open the printed URL (http://localhost:5173)
```

Visit the Vite URL, connect Spotify, type a prompt, press it.

Tracks the curator invented that don't resolve on Spotify are kept on the card
and marked `unverified` — that's the hallucination-rate measurement.

The tiny control in the bottom-right corner (dev only) cycles the candidate
wordmarks: MADE YOU A MIXTAPE / DEEP/CUTS / PROMP/TAPE.
